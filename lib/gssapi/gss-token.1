.Sh NAME
.Nm gss-token
.Nd generate and consume base64 GSS tokens
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl DNn
.Op Fl c count
.Ar service@host
.Nm
.Fl r
.Op Fl MNln
.Op Fl C Ar ccache
.Op Fl c count
.Op Ar service@host
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
generates and consumes base64 encoded GSS tokens.
By default, it runs as an initiator and with the
.Fl r
flag it becomes an acceptor.
.Pp
.Nm
supports the following options:
.Bl -tag -width indentxxxx
.It Fl C Ar ccache
write an accepted delegated credential into
.Ar ccache .
This only makes sense if
.Fl r
is specified.
.It Fl D
delegate credentials.
This only makes sense as a client, that is when
.Fl r
is not specified.
.It Fl M
copy the default ccache to a MEMORY: ccache before each
separate write operation.
The default ccache will not pick up any obtained service
tickets.
If specified with
.Fl c ,
the cache will revert to its original state before each
new token is written.
This can be used to load test the KDC.
.It Fl N
prepend
.Dq Negotiate\ 
to generated tokens and expect it on consumed tokens.
.It Fl c Ar count
repeat the operation
.Ar count
times.
This flag only changes the behaviour when operating in initiator mode.
This is good for very basic benchmarking.
.It Fl l
loop indefinitely in acceptor mode.
.It Fl n
do not output the generated tokens.
.It Fl r
run in acceptor mode.
.El
.Pp
.Nm
takes one argument, a
.Ar host@service
specifier.
The argument is required when running as an initiator but is optional as
an acceptor.
