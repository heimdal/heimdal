 * @param init          Plugin initialization function (see krb5-plugin(7))
 * @param minor_version The plugin minor version number (0)
 * @param fini          Plugin finalization function
 * @param validate      Plugin token validation function
 *
 * The validate field is the plugin entry point that performs the bearer token
 * validation operation however the plugin desires.  It is invoked in no
 * particular order relative to other bearer token validator plugins.  The
 * plugin validate function must return KRB5_PLUGIN_NO_HANDLE if the rule is
 * not applicable to it.
 *
 * The plugin validate function has the following arguments, in this
 * order:
 *
 * -# plug_ctx, the context value output by the plugin's init function
 * -# context, a krb5_context
 * -# realm, a const char *
 * -# token_type, a const char *
 * -# token, a krb5_data *
 * -# audiences, a const pointer to an array of const char * containing
 *  expected audiences of the token (aka, acceptor names)
 * -# naudiences, a size_t count of audiences
 * -# requested_principal, a krb5_const_principal
 * -# validation result, a pointer to a krb5_boolean
 * -# actual principal, a krb5_principal * output parameter (optional)
