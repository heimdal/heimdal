 * @param fini          Plugin finalization function

 *
 * The authorize field is the plugin entry point that performs authorization of
 * CSRs for kx509 however the plugin desires.  It is invoked in no particular
 * order relative to other CSR authorization plugins.  The plugin authorize
 * function must return KRB5_PLUGIN_NO_HANDLE if the rule is not applicable to
 * it.
 *
 * The plugin authorize function has the following arguments, in this
 * order:
 *
 * -# plug_ctx, the context value output by the plugin's init function
 * -# context, a krb5_context
 * -# app, the name of the application
 * -# csr, a hx509_request
 * -# client, a krb5_const_principal
 * -# authorization_result, a pointer to a krb5_boolean
 *
 * @ingroup krb5_support
