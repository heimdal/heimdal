.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
Compiles an ASN.1 module into C source code and header files.
.Pp
Options supported:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl Fl template
Use the
.Dq template
backend instead of the
.Dq codegen
backend (which is the default backend).
The template backend generates
.Dq templates
which are akin to bytecode, and which are interpreted at
run-time.
The codegen backend generates C code for all functions directly,
with no template interpretation.
The template backend scales better than the codegen backend
because as we add support for more encoding rules the templates
stay mostly the same, thus scaling linearly with size of module.
Whereas the codegen backend scales linear with the product of
module size and number of encoding rules supported.
More importantly, currently only the template backend supports
automatic decoding of open types via X.681/X.682/X.683
annotations.
.It Fl Fl prefix-enum
This option should be removed because ENUMERATED types should
always have their labels prefixed.
.It Fl Fl enum-prefix=PREFIX
This option should be removed because ENUMERATED types should
always have their labels prefixed.
.It Fl Fl encode-rfc1510-bit-string
Use RFC1510, non-standard handling of
.Dq BIT STRING
types.
.It Fl Fl decode-dce-ber
.It Fl Fl support-ber
.It Fl Fl preserve-binary=TYPE-NAME
Generate
.Sq _save
fields in structs to preserve the original encoding of some
sub-value.
This is useful for cryptographic applications to avoid having to
re-encode values to check signatures, etc.
.It Fl Fl sequence=TYPE-NAME
Generate add/remove functions for
.Sq SET OF
and
.Sq SEQUENCE OF
types.
.It Fl Fl one-code-file
Generate a single source code file.
Otherwise a separate code file will be generated for every type.
.It Fl Fl gen-name=NAME
Use
.Ar NAME
to form the names of the files generated.
.It Fl Fl option-file=FILE
Take additional command-line options from
.Ar FILE .
.It Fl Fl original-order
Attempt to preserve the original order of type definition in the
ASN.1 module.
By default the compiler generates types in a topological sort
order.
.It Fl Fl no-parse-units
Do not generate to-int / from-int functions for enumeration
types.
.It Fl Fl type-file=C-HEADER-FILE
Generate an include of the named header file that might be needed
for common type defintions.
