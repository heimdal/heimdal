.Sh DESCRIPTION
Serves the following resources:
.Ar /get-keys and
.Ar /get-config .
.Pp
The
.Ar /get-keys
end-point allows callers to get keytab content for named
principals, possibly performing write operations such as creating
a non-existent principal, or rotating its keys, if requested.
.Pp
The
.Ar /get-config
end-point allows callers to get
.Nm krb5.conf
contents for a given principal.
.Pp
This service can run against a local HDB, or against a remote HDB
via the
.Nm kadmind(8)
protocol.
Read operations are always allowed, but write operations can be
preformed either against writable
.Nm kadmind(8)
server(s) or redirected to another
.Nm httpkadmind(8).
.Pp
The
.Ar /get-config
end-point accepts a single query parameter:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent
.It Ar princ=PRINCIPAL .
.El
.Pp
The
.Ar /get-keys
end-point accepts various parameters:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent
.It Ar spn=PRINCIPAL
Names the host-based service principal whose keys to get.
May be given multiple times, and all named principal's keys will
be fetched.
.It Ar dNSName=HOSTNAME
Names the host-based service principal's hostname whose keys to get.
May be given multiple times, and all named principal's keys will
be fetched.
.It Ar service=SERVICE
Hostnames given with
.Ar dNSName=HOSTNAME
will be qualified with this service name to form a host-based
service principal.
May be given multiple times, in which case the cartesian product
of
.Ar dNSName=HOSTNAME
ad
.Ar service=SERVICE
will be used.
Defaults to
.Ar HTTP .
.It realm=REALM
Must be present if the
.Nm httpkadmind
daemon's default realm is not desired.
.It Ar enctypes=ENCTYPE,...
A comma-separated list of enctypes that the principal is expected
to support (used for Kerberos Ticket session key negotiation).
Defaults to the
.Ar supported_enctypes
configured in
.Nm krb5.conf(5) .
.It Ar materialize=true
If the named principal(s) is (are) virtual, this will cause it
(them) to be materialized as a concrete principal.
(Currently not supported.)
.It Ar create=true
If the named principal(s) does not (do not) exist, this will
cause it (them) to be created.
.It Ar rotate=true
This will cause the keys of concrete principals to be rotated.
.It Ar revoke=true
This will cause old keys of concrete principals to be deleted
if their keys are being rotated.
This means that extant service tickets with those principals as
the target will not be able to be decrypted by the caller as it
will not have the necessary keys.
.El
.Pp
Authorization is handled via the same mechanism as in
.Nm bx509d(8)
which was originally intended to authorize certification requests
(CSRs).
Authorization for extracting keys is specified like for
.Nm bx509d(8) ,
but using
.Nm [ext_keytab]
as the
.Nm krb5.conf(5) section.
Clients with host-based principals for the the host service can
create and extract keys for their own service name, but otherwise
a number of service names are not denied:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent
.It Dq host
.It Dq root
.It Dq exceed
.El
as well as all the service names for Heimdal-specific services:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent
.It Dq krbtgt
.It Dq iprop
.It Dq kadmin
.It Dq hprop
.It Dq WELLKNOWN
.It Dq K
.El
.Pp

certificiate.
.It Xo
.Fl T Ar HTTP-AUTH-TYPE,
.Fl Fl token-authentication-type= Ns Ar HTTP-AUTH-TYPE

.Xc
Uses a thread per-client instead of as many threads as there are CPUs.
.It Xo
.Fl Fl realm= Ns Ar REALM

Note that clients can request keys for principals in other realms, and
.Nm httpkadmind
will attempt to satisfy those requests too.
.It Xo
.Fl Fl read-only
.Xc
Do not perform write operations.
Write operations will either fail or if a primary
.Nm httpkadmind
URI is configured, then they will be redirected there.
.It Xo

Use a local HDB, at least for read operations, and, if
.Fl Fl local-read-only
is not given, then also write operations.
.It Xo
.Fl Fl local-read-only
.Xc
Do not perform writes on a local HDB.
Either redirect write operations if a primary
.Nm httpkadmind
URI is configured, or use a writable remote
.Nm kadmind
server.
.It Xo
