.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
reads and displays the current tickets in a credential cache or
credentials cache collection.
.Pp
A credentials cache collection is a collection of related
credentials caches for the same user, each possibly containing
credentials for different principals.
.Pp
By default
.Nm
will list just the given credentials cache or the default one if
one is not given.  However,
.Nm
may also list all credentials caches in the collection, or a
credentials cache in that collection for a given principal.
.Pp
Options supported:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c Ar cache , Fl Fl cache= Ns Ar cache
Identify a credentials cache to list or crendetials cache whose
containing crendetials cache collection will be listed.
.It Fl Fl default-for= Ns Ar principal
Use the cache in the named credentials cache collection where
credentials would be stored for the given
.Ar principal .
.It Fl Fl search-for= Ns Ar principal
Look for a cache in the named credentials cache collection where
credentials can be found for the given
.Ar principal .
.It Fl C
Print just the full name of the credential cache.
This is useful in conjunction with
.Fl Fl default-for= Ns Ar principal
and/or
.Fl Fl search-for= Ns Ar principal .
For example, one might set
.Ev KRB5CCNAME
to the output of
.Nm
.Fl C
.Fl Fl default-for= Ns Ar some-principal
to execute commands with that principal's credentials.
.It Fl s , Fl t , Fl Fl test
Test for there being an active and valid TGT for the local realm of
the user in the credential cache.
.It Fl T , Fl Fl tokens
display AFS tokens
.It Fl f
Include ticket flags in short form, each character stands for a
specific flag, as follows:
.Bl -tag -width  XXX -compact -offset indent
.It F
forwardable
.It f
forwarded
.It P
proxiable
.It p
proxied
.It D
postdate-able
.It d
postdated
.It R
renewable
.It I
initial
.It i
invalid
.It A
pre-authenticated
.It H
hardware authenticated
.El
.Pp
This information is also output with the
.Fl Fl verbose
option, but in a more verbose way.
.It Fl v , Fl Fl verbose
Verbose output. Include all possible information:
.Bl -tag -width XXXX -offset indent
.It Server
the principal the ticket is for
.It Ticket etype
the encryption type used in the ticket, followed by the key version of
the ticket, if it is available
.It Session key
the encryption type of the session key, if it's different from the
encryption type of the ticket
.It Auth time
the time the authentication exchange took place
.It Start time
the time that this ticket is valid from (only printed if it's
different from the auth time)
.It End time
when the ticket expires, if it has already expired this is also noted
.It Renew till
the maximum possible end time of any ticket derived from this one
.It Ticket flags
the flags set on the ticket
.It Addresses
the set of addresses from which this ticket is valid
.El
.It Fl l , Fl Fl list-caches
List the credential caches for the current users, not all cache types
supports listing multiple caches.
.Pp
.El
.Sh NOTES
All built-in credentials cache types in Heimdal are collection
types.
A credentials cache collection is just that: a collection of
credentials caches, all for the same user.
The names of the caches in the collection are "subsidiary" to the
collection.
.Pp
Generally, the name of a credentials cache is of the form
.Ar TYPE:collection-name[:subsidiary-name] ,
such as
.Dq KCM:1000:some-name-here .
Both, the
.Ar FILE
and
.Ar DIR
credentials cache types use an alternative credentials cache name
form of
.Ar TYPE:collection-name[+subsidiary-name] ,
such as
.Dq FILE:/tmp/krb5cc_1000+some-name-here .
.Pp
The
.Ar FILE
credentials cache type must be enabled by setting
.Ar [libdefaults] Ar enable_file_cache_iteration = yes
in the
.Ar krb5.conf
file.
This is disabled by default to avoid potentially listing the
user's temporary file directory, which is where the
.Ar FILE
credentials cache type normally stores its caches.
When this is disabled, then
.Nm
.Fl l
will not list more than the default credentials cache when using
the
.Ar FILE
credentials cache type.
