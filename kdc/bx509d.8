.Sh ONLINE CERTIFICATION AUTHORITY HTTP API
This service provides an HTTP-based Certification Authority (CA).
CA credentials and configuration are specified in the
.Va [bx509]
section of
.Xr krb5.conf 5 .
.Pp
The protocol consists of a
.Ar GET
of
.Ar /get-cert
with the base-63 encoding of a DER encoding of a PKCS#10
.Ar CertificationRequest
(Certificate Signing Request, or CSR) in a
.Ar csr
required query parameter.
In a successful query, the response body will contain a PEM
encoded end entity certificate and certification chain.
.Pp
Or
.Ar GET
of
.Ar /bx509 ,
as this used to be called.
.Pp
Authentication is required.
Unauthenticated requests will elicit a 401 response.
.Pp
Authorization is required.
Unauthorized requests will elicit a 403 response.
.Pp
Subject Alternative Names (SANs) and Extended Key Usage values
may be requested, both in-band in the CSR as a requested
extensions attribute, and/or via optional query parameters.
.Pp
Supported query parameters (separated by ampersands)
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent
.It Li csr = Va base64-encoded-DER-encoded-CSR
.It Li dNSName = Va hostname
.It Li rfc822Name = Va email-address
.It Li xMPPName = Va XMPP-address
.It Li krb5PrincipalName = Va Kerberos-principal-name
.It Li ms-upn = Va UPN
.It Li eku = Va OID
.It Li lifetime = Va lifetime
.El
.Pp
More than one name or EKU may be requested.
.Pp
Certificate lifetimes are expressed as a decimal number and
an optional unit (which defaults to
.Dq day
).
.Sh NEGOTIATE TOKEN HTTP API
This service provides an HTTP-based Negotiate token service.
This service requires a certification authority (CA) issuer
credential as it impersonates client principals to the KDC using
PKINIT client certificates it issues itself.
.Pp
The protocol consists of a
.Ar GET
of
.Ar /get-negotiate-token
with a
.Ar target = Ar service@host
query parameter.
.Pp
In a successful query, the response body will contain a Negotiate
token for the authenticated client principal to the requested
target.
.Pp
Authentication is required.
Unauthenticated requests will elicit a 401 response.
.Pp
Subject Alternative Names (SANs) and Extended Key Usage values
may be requested, both in-band in the CSR as a requested
extensions attribute, and/or via optional query parameters.
.Pp
Supported query parameters (separated by ampersands)
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent
.It Li target = Va service@hostname
.It Li redirect = Va URI
.El
.Pp
If a redirect URI is given and a matching
.Va Referer
header is included in the request, then the response will be a
redirect to that URI with the Negotiate token in an
.Va Authorization
header that the user-agent should copy to the redirected request.
.Pp
The certification authority configuration is the same as for the
.Va /get-cert
end-point, but as configured in the
.Va [get-tgt]
section of
.Xr krb5.conf 5 .
.Sh TGT HTTP API
This service provides an HTTP-based "kinit" service.
This service requires a certification authority (CA) issuer
credential as it impersonates client principals to the KDC using
PKINIT client certificates it issues itself.
.Pp
The protocol consists of a
.Ar GET
of
.Ar /get-tgt .
.Pp
Supported query parameters (separated by ampersands)
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent
.It Li cname = Va principal-name
.It Li address = Va IP-address
.El
.Pp
In a successful query, the response body will contain a TGT and
its session key encoded as a "ccache" file contents.
.Pp
Authentication is required.
Unauthenticated requests will elicit a 401 response.
.Pp
Authorization is required, where the authorization check is the
same as for
.Va /get-cert
by the authenticated client principal to get a certificate with
a PKINIT SAN for itself or the requested principal if a
.Va cname
query parameter was included.
.Pp
Unauthorized requests will elicit a 403 response.
.Pp
Requested IP addresses will be added to the issued TGT if allowed.
The IP address of the client will be included if address-less TGTs
are not allowed.
See the
.Va [get-tgt]
section of
.Xr krb5.conf 5 .
.Pp
The certification authority configuration is the same as for the
.Va /get-cert
end-point, but as configured in the

section of
