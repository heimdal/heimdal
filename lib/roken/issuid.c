     * We want to use issetugid(), but issetugid() is not the same on
     * all OSes.
     *
     * On OpenBSD (where issetugid() originated), Illumos derivatives,
     * and Solaris, issetugid() returns true IFF the program exec()ed
     * was set-uid or set-gid.
     *
     * FreeBSD departed from OpenBSD's issetugid() semantics, and other
     * BSDs (NetBSD, DragonFly) and OS X adopted FreeBSD's.
     *
     * FreeBSDs' issetugid() returns true if the program exec()ed was
     * set-uid or set-gid, or if the process has switched UIDs/GIDs or
     * otherwise changed privileges or is a descendant of such a process
     * and has not exec()ed since.
     *
     * The FreeBSD/NetBSD issetugid() does us no good because we _want_
     * to trust the environment when the process started life as
     * non-set-uid root (or otherwise privileged).  There's nothing
     * about _dropping_ privileges (without having gained them first)
     * that taints the environment.  It's not like calling system(),
     * say, might change the environment of the caller.
     *
     * We want OpenBSD's issetugid() semantics.
     *
     * Linux, meanwhile, has no issetugid() (at least glibc doesn't
     * anyways) but has an equivalent: getauxval(AT_SECURE).
     *
     * To be really specific: we want getauxval(AT_SECURE) semantics
     * because there may be ways in which a process might gain privilege
     * at exec time other than by exec'ing a set-id program.
     *
     * Where we use getauxval(), we really use our getauxval(), the one
     * that isn't broken the way glibc's used to be.  Our getauxval()
     * also works on more systems than actually provide one.
     *
     * In order to avoid FreeBSD issetugid() semantics, where available,
     * we use the ELF auxilliary vector to implement OpenBSD semantics
     * before finally falling back on issetugid().
     *
     * All of this is as of April 2017, and might become stale in the
     * future.
