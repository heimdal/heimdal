.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to authenticate to the Kerberos server as
.Ar principal ,
or if none is given, a system generated default (typically your login
name at the default realm), and acquire a ticket granting ticket that
can later be used to obtain tickets for other services.
.Pp
Supported options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c Ar cachename | Fl Fl cache= Ns Ar cachename
The credentials cache to put the acquired ticket in, if other than
default.
.It Fl Fl no-change-default
By default the principal's credentials will be stored in the default
credential cache.  This option will cause them to instead be stored
only in a cache whose name is derived from the principal's name.  Note
that
.Xr klist 1
with the
.Fl l
option will list all the credential caches the user has, along with
the name of the principal whose credentials are stored therein.  This
option is ignored if the
.Fl c Ar cachename | Fl Fl cache= Ns Ar cachename
option is given.
See also
.Xr kswitch 1 .
.It Fl Fl default-for-principal
If this option is given and
.Fl c Ar cachename | Fl Fl cache= Ns Ar cachename
is not given, then the cache that will be used will be one that
is appropriate for the client principal.  For example, if the
default cache type is
.Ar FILE
then the default cache may be either
.Ar FILE:/tmp/krb5cc_%{uid}+%{principal_name}
or
.Ar FILE:/tmp/krb5cc_%{uid}
if the principal is the default principal for the user, meaning
that it is of the form
.Ar ${USER}@${user_realm}
or
.Ar ${USER}@${default_realm} .
This option implies
.Fl Fl no-change-default
unless
.Fl Fl change-default
is given.  Caches for the user can be listed with the
.Fl l
option to
.Xr klist 1 .
.It Fl f Fl Fl forwardable
Obtain a ticket than can be forwarded to another host.
.It Fl F Fl Fl no-forwardable
Do not obtain a forwardable ticket.
.It Fl t Ar keytabname , Fl Fl keytab= Ns Ar keytabname
Don't ask for a password, but instead get the key from the specified
keytab.
.It Fl l Ar time , Fl Fl lifetime= Ns Ar time
Specifies the lifetime of the ticket.
The argument can either be in seconds, or a more human readable string
like
.Sq 1h .
.It Fl p , Fl Fl proxiable
Request tickets with the proxiable flag set.
.It Fl R , Fl Fl renew
Try to renew a ticket.
The ticket must have the
.Sq renewable
flag set, and must not be expired. If the
.Oo Fl S Ar principal Oc
option is specified, the ticket for the indicated service is renewed.
If no service is explicitly specified, an attempt is made to renew the
TGT for the client realm.  If no TGT for the client realm is found in the
credential cache, an attempt is made to renew the TGT for the defaualt
realm (if that is found in the credential cache), or else the first
TGT found.  This makes it easier for users to renew forwarded tickets
that are not issued by the origin realm.
.It Fl Fl renewable
The same as
.Fl Fl renewable-life ,
with an infinite time.
.It Fl r Ar time , Fl Fl renewable-life= Ns Ar time
The max renewable ticket life.
.It Fl S Ar principal , Fl Fl server= Ns Ar principal
Get a ticket for a service other than krbtgt/LOCAL.REALM.
.It Fl s Ar time , Fl Fl start-time= Ns Ar time
Obtain a ticket that starts to be valid
.Ar time
(which can really be a generic time specification, like
.Sq 1h )
seconds into the future.
.It Fl k , Fl Fl use-keytab
The same as
.Fl Fl keytab ,
but with the default keytab name (normally
.Ar FILE:/etc/krb5.keytab ) .
.It Fl v , Fl Fl validate
Try to validate an invalid ticket.
.It Fl e , Fl Fl enctypes= Ns Ar enctypes
Request tickets with this particular enctype.
.It Fl Fl password-file= Ns Ar filename
read the password from the first line of
.Ar filename .
If the
.Ar filename
is
.Ar STDIN ,
the password will be read from the standard input.
.It Fl Fl fcache-version= Ns Ar version-number
Create a credentials cache of version
.Ar version-number .
.It Fl a , Fl Fl extra-addresses= Ns Ar enctypes
Adds a set of addresses that will, in addition to the systems local
addresses, be put in the ticket.
This can be useful if all addresses a client can use can't be
automatically figured out.
One such example is if the client is behind a firewall.
Also settable via
.Li libdefaults/extra_addresses
in
.Xr krb5.conf 5 .
.It Fl A , Fl Fl no-addresses
Request a ticket with no addresses.
.It Fl n , Fl Fl anonymous
Request an anonymous ticket.
With the default (false) setting of the
.Ar historical_anon_pkinit
configuration parameter, if the principal is specified as @REALM, then
anonymous PKINIT will be used to acquire an unauthenticated anonymous ticket
and both the client name and (with fully RFC-comformant KDCs) realm in the
returned ticket will be anonymized.
Otherwise, authentication proceeds as normal and the anonymous ticket will have
only the client name anonymized.
With
.Ar historical_anon_pkinit
set to
.Li true ,
the principal is interpreted as a realm even without an at-sign prefix, and it
is not possible to obtain authenticated anonymized tickets.
.It Fl Fl enterprise
Parse principal as a enterprise (KRB5-NT-ENTERPRISE) name. Enterprise
names are email like principals that are stored in the name part of
the principal, and since there are two @ characters the parser needs
to know that the first is not a realm.
An example of an enterprise name is
.Dq lha@e.kth.se@KTH.SE ,
and this option is usually used with canonicalize so that the
principal returned from the KDC will typically be the real principal
name.
.It Fl Fl gss-mech
Enable GSS-API pre-authentication using the specified mechanism OID. Unless
.Ar gss-name
is also set, then the specified principal name will be used as the GSS-API
initiator name. If the principal is specified as @REALM or left unspecified,
then the default GSS-API credential will be used.
.It Fl Fl gss-name
Attempt GSS-API pre-authentication using an initiator name distinct from the
Kerberos client principal,
.It Fl Fl afslog
Gets AFS tickets, converts them to version 4 format, and stores them
in the kernel.
Only useful if you have AFS.
.El
.Pp
The
.Ar forwardable ,
.Ar proxiable ,
.Ar ticket_life ,
and
.Ar renewable_life
options can be set to a default value from the
.Dv appdefaults
section in krb5.conf, see
.Xr krb5_appdefault 3 .
.Pp
If  a
.Ar command
is given,
.Nm
will set up new credentials caches, and AFS PAG, and then run the given
command.
When it finishes the credentials will be removed.
.Sh CREDENTIALS CACHE TYPES
Heimdal supports a number of credentials cache types:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It FILE
Uses a file per-cache with a binary format common to other Kerberos
implementations.
.It DIR
Uses a directory with multiple files, one per-cache in a collection.
.It SCC
Uses a SQLite3 database with multiple caches in the database.
.It KEYRING
Uses a Linux keyring.
.It KCM
Uses a inter-process communications (IPC) to talk to a daemon typically named
.Nm kcm .
.It API
Uses KCM or else a shared object that implements the "CCAPI".
.It MEMORY
Uses in-process memory (which disappears on process exit, so this if of little
use in this program,
.Nm
).
.El
.Sh CREDENTIALS CACHE COLLECTIONS
Every credentials cache's name consists of its cache type (e.g.,
FILE), a possibly-optional collection name, and a possibly
optional "subsidiary" name naming a single cache in the
collection.
.Pp
The convention in Heimdal is that a cache's subsidiary cache name
is the name of the client principal whose credentials are
expected to be stored and found in that cache, with the following
characters replaced with a hyphen: slash, backslash, colon, and
plus.
.Pp
The caches in a credentials cache collection can be listed by the
.Xr klist 1
command.
The
.Sq FILE
credentials cache type supports listing of caches in the
collection only when the
.Ql enable_file_cache_iteration
is set to
.Ql yes
in the
.Ql [libdefaults]
section of
.Xr krb5.conf 5 .
.Sh CREDENTIALS CACHE NAMES
The general syntax for credentials cache names is
.Dl TYPE:[collection-name][:subsidiary]
except that for the FILE type it is
.Dl FILE:[collection-name][+subsidiary]
(because colons are not allowed in filenames on Windows) and for
the KEYRING type it is:
.Dl KEYRING:[anchor:][collection[:subsidiary]]
where the collection name is free-form and the anchor is one of
.Sq process ,
.Sq thread ,
or
.Sq legacy .
.Pp
The collection name is always absent for the
.Ql MEMORY
credentials cache type.
Application developers should note that the
.Ql MEMORY:anonymous
cache is always unique.
.Pp
When the collection name is absent then the default collection
for the given credentials cache type is used.
These defaults can be configured in
.Xr krb5.conf 5
in the
.Ql [libdefaults]
section's
.Ql default_ccache_name_by_type
parameter.
The hard-coded defaults are:
.Bl -tag -compact
.It Ql /tmp/krb5cc_{UID}
for FILE caches, where {UID} is a numeric user ID
.It Ql /tmp/krb5cc_{UID}_dir
for DIR caches, where {UID} is a numeric user ID
.It Ql /tmp/krb5scc_{UID}
for SCC caches, where {UID} is a numeric user ID, and where the
named file is a SQLite3 database file
.It Ql {UID}
for KCM caches, where {UID} is the user's numeric user ID
.It <implementation-specific>
for API (CCAPI) credentials caches
.El
.Pp
NOTE: Currently the collection name is always required for the
FILE cache type.
