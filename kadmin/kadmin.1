.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program is used to make modifications to the Kerberos database, either remotely via the
.Xr kadmind 8
daemon, or locally (with the
.Fl l
option).
.Pp
Supported options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl p Ar string , Fl Fl principal= Ns Ar string
principal to authenticate as
.It Fl K Ar string , Fl Fl keytab= Ns Ar string
keytab for authentication principal
.It Fl c Ar file , Fl Fl config-file= Ns Ar file
location of config file
.It Fl H Ar HDB , Fl Fl hdb= Ns Ar HDB
location of HDB
.It Fl k Ar file , Fl Fl key-file= Ns Ar file
location of master key file
.It Fl r Ar realm , Fl Fl realm= Ns Ar realm
realm to use
.It Fl a Ar host , Fl Fl admin-server= Ns Ar host
server to contact
.It Fl s Ar port number , Fl Fl server-port= Ns Ar port number
port to use
.It Fl l , Fl Fl local
local admin mode
.El
.Pp
If no
.Ar command
is given on the command line,
.Nm
will prompt for commands to process. Some of the commands that take
one or more principals as argument
.Ns ( Nm delete ,
.Nm ext_keytab ,
.Nm get ,
.Nm list ,
.Nm modify ,
and
.Nm passwd )
will accept a glob style wildcard, and perform the operation on all
matching principals.
.Pp
Commands include:
.\" not using a list here, since groff apparently gets confused
.\" with nested Xo/Xc
.Pp
.Nm add
.Op Fl r | Fl Fl random-key
.Op Fl Fl enctypes= Ns Ar string
.Op Fl Fl random-password
.Op Fl p Ar string \*(Ba Fl Fl password= Ns Ar string
.Op Fl Fl key= Ns Ar string
.Op Fl Fl max-ticket-life= Ns Ar lifetime
.Op Fl Fl max-renewable-life= Ns Ar lifetime
.Op Fl Fl attributes= Ns Ar attributes
.Op Fl Fl expiration-time= Ns Ar time
.Op Fl Fl pw-expiration-time= Ns Ar time
.Op Fl Fl policy= Ns Ar policy-name
.Op Fl Fl use-defaults
.Ar principal...
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
Adds a new principal to the database. The options not passed on the
command line will be promped for.
If enctypes to use are not given, then the
.Ar [libdefaults] supported_enctypes
configuration parameter will be used on the client side to select
enctypes, defaulting to
.Ar aes128-cts-hmac-sha1-96.
For compatibility with MIT, the enctypes string is a space- or
comma-separated list of enctype:salttype.
If
.Fl Fl keepold
is given, then old keys needed to decrypt extant tickets are
kept, and all other old keys are deleted.
If
.Fl Fl keepallold
is given then all old keys are kept.  If
.Fl Fl pruneall is given then all old keys are removed.
The
.Fl Fl keepold
behavior is the default if none of these are given.
The only policy supported by Heimdal servers is
.Ql default .
.Pp
If some parameters are not given then they will be prompted for
unless the
.Fl Fl use-defaults
option is given, in which case defaults will be taken from the
principal named
.Dq default .
.Pp
This command has the following aliases:
.Nm ank ,
.Nm add_new_key .
.Ed
.Pp
.Nm add_alias
.Ar principal
.Ar alias...
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
Adds one or more aliases to the given principal.
.Pp
There are two types of aliases: hard, and soft.
A soft alias is an alias of a principal of the form
.Ar WELLKNOWN/REFERRALS/TARGET@target_realm
or
.Ar WELLKNOWN/REFERRALS/TARGET/arbitrary-component@target_realm .
A hard alias is an alias of any normal principal, even if in a
different realm.
.Pp
Hard aliases are treated as distinct principals sharing
attributes and keys with their canonical principals.
If a client requests canonicalization of a hard alias name, the
KDC will use the canonical name in the ticket issued as long as
the alias and canonical names are in the same realm.
Conversely, if a client does not request canonicalization, or if
the hard alias and the canonical name have different realms, then
the KDC will issue a ticket for the alias name.
.Pp
Soft aliases can only be used to configure the production of
referrals by the KDC.
When a client requests a ticket for a principal that turns out to
be a soft alias, the KDC will respond with a referral to the
alias' canonical name's realm.
.Pp
Soft aliasing compares favorably to using
.Ar [domain_realm]
entries in the KDC's
.Ar krb5.conf :
soft aliases may be managed via the
.Nm kadmin
command and its
.Nm add_alias
and
.Nm del_alias
sub-commands rather than having to edit the KDC's configuration
file and having to restart the KDC.
.Pp
There are two methods for configuring the issuance of referrals
for entire namespaces of hostnames.
A soft alias of the form
.Ar  WELLKNOWN/HOSTBASED-NAMESPACE/service/namespace-fqdn@REALM
(see
.Nm add_namespace
below) will cause all requests for host-based principals in the
given namespace to be referred to the given realm.
Alternatively, the KDC will issue referrals for all host-based
service principals whose hostname component matches a
.Ar [domain_realm]
entry in the KDC's
.Ar krb5.conf
file referring to a different realm.
.Ed
.Pp
.Nm add_namespace
.Ar Fl Fl key-rotation-epoch= Ns Ar time
.Ar Fl Fl key-rotation-period= Ns Ar time
.Op Fl Fl enctypes= Ns Ar string
.Op Fl Fl max-ticket-life= Ns Ar lifetime
.Op Fl Fl max-renewable-life= Ns Ar lifetime
.Op Fl Fl attributes= Ns Ar attributes
.Ar host-based-principal...
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
Adds a new namespace of virtual host-based or domain-based
principals to the database, whose keys will be automatically
derived from base keys stored in the namespace record, and which
keys will be rotated automatically.
The namespace names are of the same form as host-based principal
names:
.Ar service/hostname@REALM
and these will match all host-based or domain-based service names
where hostname component of such a principal ends in the labels
of the hostname in the namespace name.
.Pp
The service name component may be a wild-card (underscore,
.Ar _ ),
in which case it will match any service.
.Pp
For example,
.Ar bar.baz.example@BAZ.EXAMPLE
will match
.Ar host/foo.bar.baz.example@BAZ.EXAMPLE
but not
.Ar host/foobar.baz.example@BAZ.EXAMPLE .
.Pp
Note well that services are expected to
.Ar ext_keytab
or otherwise re-fetch their keytabs at least as often as one
quarter of the key rotation period, otherwise they risk not
having keys they need to decrypt tickets with.
.Pp
The epoch must be given as either an absolute time,
.Ar "now",
or as
.Ar "+<N>[<unit>]"
where
.Ar N
is a natural and
.Ar unit
is one "s", "m", "h", "day", "week", "month", defaulting to
"month".
The default key rotation period is
.Ar 7d .
The default enctypes is as for the
.Nm add
command.
.Pp
Note that namespaces are stored as principals whose names are of the form
.Ar WELLKNOWN/HOSTBASED-NAMESPACE/service/namespace.fqdn@REALM ,
with the
.Ar service
.Pp
This command has the following alias:
.Nm add_ns .
.Ed
.Pp
.Nm add_enctype
.Op Fl r | Fl Fl random-key
.Ar principal enctypes...
.Pp
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
Adds a new encryption type to the principal, only random key are
supported.
.Ed
.Pp
.Nm delete
.Ar principal...
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
Removes a principal.
It is an error to delete an alias.
To remove a principal's alias or aliases, use the
.Nm del_alias
command.
To remove a principal given an alias, first
.Nm get
the principal to get its canonical name and then delete that.
.Ed
.Pp
.Nm del_alias
.Ar alias...
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
Deletes the given aliases, but not their canonical principals.
.Pp
This command has the following aliases:
.Nm del ,
.Nm del_entry .
.Ed
.Pp
.Nm del_enctype
.Ar principal enctypes...
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
Removes some enctypes from a principal; this can be useful if the
service belonging to the principal is known to not handle certain
enctypes.
.Ed
.Pp
.Nm prune
.Oo Fl Fl kvno= Ns Ar number
.Oc
.Ar principal
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
Deletes the named principal's keys of the given kvno.  If a kvno is
not given then this deletes all the named principal's keys that are
too old to be needed for decrypting tickets issued using those keys
(i.e., any such tickets are necessarily expired).  The determination
of "too old" is made using the max-ticket-life attribute of the
principal; though in practice that max ticket life is also constrained
by the max-ticket-life of the client principals and the krbtgt
principals, those are not consulted here.
.Ed
.Pp
.Nm ext_keytab
.Oo Fl k Ar keytab \*(Ba Xo
.Op Fl Fl random-key
.Op Fl Fl keepold | Fl Fl keepallold | Fl Fl pruneall
.Op Fl Fl enctypes= Ns Ar string
.Fl Fl keytab= Ns Ar string
.Xc
.Oc
.Ar principal...
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
Creates a keytab with the keys of the specified principals.  Requires
get-keys rights, otherwise the principal's keys are changed and saved in
the keytab.
.Pp
If the
.Fl Fl random-key
option is given then new randomly-generated keys will be set on
the principal.
.Pp
If enctypes to use are not given, then the
.Ar [libdefaults] supported_enctypes
configuration parameter will be used on the client side to select
enctypes, defaulting to
.Ar aes128-cts-hmac-sha1-96.
For compatibility with MIT, the enctypes string is a space- or
comma-separated list of enctype:salttype.
If
.Fl Fl keepold
is given, then old keys needed to decrypt extant tickets are
kept, and all other old keys are deleted.
If
.Fl Fl keepallold
is given then all old keys are kept.  If
.Fl Fl pruneall is given then all old keys are removed.
The
.Fl Fl keepold
behavior is the default if none of these are given.
.Ed

.Op Fl C Ar path | Fl Fl krb5-config-file= Ns Ar path
.Op Fl Fl upto= Ns Ar number
.Ar principal...
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
Lists the matching principals, short prints the result as a table,
while long format produces a more verbose output.
If the
.Fl Fl upto= Ns Ar number
option is given, then only up to that many principals will be
listed.
.Pp
Which columns to print can be selected with the
.Fl o
option. The argument is a comma separated list of column names
optionally appended with an equal sign
.Pq Sq =
and a column header. Which columns are printed by default differ
slightly between short and long output.
.Pp
The JSON options will cause
.Nm kadmin 
to output JSON.
The
.Fl Fl json-ascii
option implies
.Fl Fl json
and causes all non-ASCII characters in strings to be backslash-u
escaped.
If both
.Fl Fl json
and
.Fl Fl terse
are given, then the output will be JSON strings consisting of
principal names.
If
.Fl Fl json
is given, then the output will be JSON objects with each object
being a representation of the principal.
If the
.Fl Fl json-with-keys
option is given, then the output will be as with the
.Fl Fl json
option, but will also include real key values if the user has
permission to get keys, else it may include bogus,
incorrect-length keys.
.Pp
The default terse output format is similar to
.Fl s o Ar principal= ,
just printing the names of matched principals.
.Pp
If
.Fl C
or
.Fl Fl krb5-config-file
is given and the principal has krb5 config file contents saved
in its HDB entry, then that will be saved in the given file.
Note that if multiple principals are requested, then the second,
third, and so on will have -1, -2, and so on appended to the
given filename unless the given filename is a device name.
.Pp
Possible column names include:
.Li principal ,
.Li princ_expire_time ,
.Li pw_expiration ,
.Li last_pwd_change ,
.Li max_life ,
.Li max_rlife ,
.Li mod_time ,
.Li mod_name ,
.Li attributes ,
.Li kvno ,
.Li mkvno ,
.Li last_success ,
.Li last_failed ,
.Li fail_auth_count ,

Same as the
.Nm get
command, but defaults to terse output.
The

.Ar principal...
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
Modifies certain attributes of a principal. If run without command
line options, you will be prompted. With command line options, it will
only change the ones specified.
.Pp
The
.Fl Fl alias= Ns Ar alias-name
option may be given multiple times.
If this option is used at all, the complete list of aliases must
be given, with one option per-alias.
If the list given has fewer aliases than the principal had prior
to the modification, then the missing aliases will be deleted.
.Pp
Use the
.Nm add_alias
command instead to add an alias to avoid having to list all
existing aliases to keep.
.Pp
The
.Fl Fl alias=
option without a value allows the user to set an empty list of
aliases.
Use the
.Nm del_alias
command to delete one or more aliases.
.Pp
The only policy supported by Heimdal is
.Ql default .
.Pp
If a krb5 config file is given, it will be saved in the entry.
.Pp
Possible attributes are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds

.It no-auth-data-reqd
do not include a PAC in tickets issued to this service
.It auth-data-reqd
do include a PAC in tickets issued to this service even if the
.Li disable_pac
KDC configuration parameter is set to true
.El
.Pp
Attributes may be negated with a "-", e.g.,
.Pp
kadmin -l modify -a -disallow-proxiable user
.Pp
The
.Fl Fl constrained-delegation= Ns Ar principal-name
option is not currently implemented.
.Pp
The
.Fl Fl pkinit-acl= Ns Ar subject-name
option authorizes clients with certificates with the given
subject distinguished name to get tickets for the principal using
PKINIT.
This option can be given multiple times.
The PKINIT ACLs set with this option will replace the existing
ones.
.Pp
The
.Fl Fl service-enctypes= Ns Ar enctype
option indicates that the service supports the given enctype
regardless of whether the service has long-term keys of that
enctype.
This option can be given multiple times and will replace the
existing set of enctypes supported by the service.
If a service principal does not have any supported enctypes then
the KDC will assume that it supports only the enctypes of all of
its long-term keys.
.Pp
This command has the following alias:
.Nm mod .
.Ed
.Pp
.Nm passwd
.Op Fl Fl keepold | Fl Fl keepallold | Fl Fl pruneall
.Op Fl Fl enctypes= Ns Ar string
.Op Fl r | Fl Fl random-key
.Op Fl Fl random-password
.Oo Fl p Ar string \*(Ba Xo
.Fl Fl password= Ns Ar string
.Xc
.Oc
.Op Fl Fl key= Ns Ar string
.Ar principal...
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
Changes the password of an existing principal.
If enctypes to use are not given, then the
.Ar [libdefaults] supported_enctypes
configuration parameter will be used on the client side to select
enctypes, defaulting to
.Ar aes128-cts-hmac-sha1-96.
For compatibility with MIT, the enctypes string is a space- or
comma-separated list of enctype:salttype.
If
.Fl Fl keepold
is given, then old keys needed to decrypt extant tickets are
kept, and all other old keys are deleted.
If
.Fl Fl keepallold
is given then all old keys are kept.  If
.Fl Fl pruneall is given then all old keys are removed.
The
.Fl Fl keepold
behavior is the default if none of these are given.
.Pp
This command has the following aliases:
.Nm cpw ,
.Nm change_password .
.Ed
.Pp
.Nm verify-password-quality
.Ar principal
.Ar password
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
Run the password quality check function locally.
You can run this on the host that is configured to run the kadmind
process to verify that your configuration file is correct.
The verification is done locally, if kadmin is run in remote mode,
no rpc call is done to the server. NOTE: if the environment has
verify-password-quality configured to use a back-end that stores
password history (such as heimdal-history), running
verify-quality-password will cause an update to the password
database meaning that merely verifying the quality of the password
using verify-quality-password invalidates the use of that
principal/password in the future.
.Pp
This command has the following alias:
.Nm pwq .
.Ed
.Pp
.Nm privileges
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
Lists the operations you are allowed to perform. These include
.Li add ,
.Li add_enctype ,
.Li change-password ,
.Li delete ,
.Li del_enctype ,
.Li get ,
.Li get-keys ,
.Li list ,
and
.Li modify .
.Pp
This command has the following alias:
.Nm privs .
.Ed
.Pp
.Nm rename
.Ar from to
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
Renames a principal. This is normally transparent, but since keys are
salted with the principal name, they will have a non-standard salt,
and clients which are unable to cope with this will fail. Kerberos 4
suffers from this.
.Ed
.Pp
.Nm check
.Op Ar realm
.Pp
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
Check database for strange configurations on important principals. If
no realm is given, the default realm is used.
.Ed
.Pp
When running in local mode, the following commands can also be used:
.Pp
.Nm dump
.Op Fl d | Fl Fl decrypt
.Op Fl f Ns Ar format | Fl Fl format= Ns Ar format
.Op Ar dump-file
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
Writes the database in
.Dq machine readable text
form to the specified file, or standard out. If the database is
encrypted, the dump will also have encrypted keys, unless
.Fl Fl decrypt
is used.  If
.Fl Fl format=MIT
is used then the dump will be in MIT format.  Otherwise it will be in
Heimdal format.
.Ed
.Pp
.Nm init
.Op Fl Fl realm-max-ticket-life= Ns Ar string
.Op Fl Fl realm-max-renewable-life= Ns Ar string
.Op Fl Fl bare
.Ar realm
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
Initializes the Kerberos database with entries for a new realm.
It's possible to have more than one realm served by one server
with the same database.
.Pp
If the
.Fl Fl bare
option is given, then only the root krbtgt principal for that
realm will be created.
.Ed
.Pp
.Nm load
.Ar file
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
Reads a previously dumped database, and re-creates that database from
scratch.
.Ed
.Pp
.Nm merge
.Ar file
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
Similar to
.Nm load
but just modifies the database with the entries in the dump file.
.Ed
.Pp
.Nm stash
.Oo Fl e Ar enctype \*(Ba Xo
.Fl Fl enctype= Ns Ar enctype
.Xc
.Oc

.Oc
.Op Fl Fl convert-file
.Op Fl Fl master-key-fd= Ns Ar fd
.Op Fl Fl random-password
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
Writes the Kerberos master key to a file used by the KDC.
.Pp
If the
.Fl Fl convert-file
option is given then convert an existing file to the new format.
If the
.Fl Fl master-key-fd= Ns Ar fd
option is given the the password will be read from the given file
descriptor.
If the
.Fl Fl random-password
option is given then a password will be generated randomly.
.Pp
This command has the following alias:
.Nm kstash .
.Ed
.Pp
