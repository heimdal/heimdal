.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a program for managing keytabs.
Supported options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl v , Fl Fl verbose
Verbose output.
.El
.Pp
.Ar command
can be one of the following:
.Bl -tag -width srvconvert
.It Nm add Oo Fl p Ar principal Oc Oo Fl Fl principal= Ns Ar principal Oc \
Oo Fl V Ar kvno Oc Oo Fl Fl kvno= Ns Ar kvno Oc Oo Fl e Ar enctype Oc \
Oo Fl Fl keepold | Fl Fl keepallold | Fl Fl pruneall Oc \
Oo Fl Fl enctype= Ns Ar enctype Oc Oo Fl w Ar password Oc \
Oo Fl Fl password= Ns Ar password Oc Oo Fl r Oc Oo Fl Fl random Oc \
Oo Fl s Oc Oo Fl Fl no-salt Oc Oo Fl H Oc Op Fl Fl hex
Adds a key to the keytab. Options that are not specified will be
prompted for. This requires that you know the password or the hex key of the
principal to add; if what you really want is to add a new principal to
the keytab, you should consider the
.Ar get
command, which talks to the kadmin server.
.It Nm change Oo Fl r Ar realm Oc Oo Fl Fl realm= Ns Ar realm Oc \
Oo Fl Fl keepold | Fl Fl keepallold | Fl Fl pruneall Oc \
Oo Fl Fl enctype= Ns Ar enctype Oc \
Oo Fl Fl a Ar host Oc Oo Fl Fl admin-server= Ns Ar host Oc \
Oo Fl Fl s Ar port Oc Op Fl Fl server-port= Ns Ar port
Update one or several keys to new versions.  By default, use the admin
server for the realm of a keytab entry.  Otherwise it will use the
values specified by the options.
.Pp
If no principals are given, all the ones in the keytab are updated.
.It Nm copy Oo Fl Fl copy-duplicates Oc Ar keytab-src Ar keytab-dest
Copies all the entries from
.Ar keytab-src
to
.Ar keytab-dest .
Because entries already in
.Ar keytab-dest
are kept, this command functions to merge keytabs.
Entries for the same principal, key version number, and
encryption type in the
.Ar keytab-src
that are also in the
.Ar keytab-dest
will not be copied to the
.Ar keytab-dest
unless the
.Fl Fl copy-duplicates
option is given.
.It Nm get Oo Fl p Ar admin principal Oc \
Oo Fl Fl principal= Ns Ar admin principal Oc Oo Fl e Ar enctype Oc \
Oo Fl Fl no-create Oc \
Oo Fl Fl no-change-keys Oc \
Oo Fl Fl keepold | Fl Fl keepallold | Fl Fl pruneall Oc \
Oo Fl Fl enctypes= Ns Ar enctype Oc Oo Fl r Ar realm Oc \
Oo Fl Fl realm= Ns Ar realm Oc Oo Fl a Ar admin server Oc \
Oo Fl Fl admin-server= Ns Ar admin server Oc Oo Fl s Ar server port Oc \
Oo Fl Fl server-port= Ns Ar server port Oc Ar principal ...
.Pp
For each
.Ar principal ,
get a the principal's keys from the KDC via the kadmin protocol,
creating the principal if it doesn't exist (unless
.Fl Fl no-create
is given), and changing its keys to new random keys (unless
.Fl Fl no-change-keys
is given).
.Pp
If no
.Ar realm
is specified, the realm to operate on is taken from the first
principal.
.It Nm import Oo JSON-FILE Oc
Read JSON objects or arrays of objects where the objects are
keytab entries as serialized by the
.Nm ktutil list
.Fl Fl json
.Fl Fl keys
command, and append the keytab entries to the keytab, creating it
if it doesn't exist.
.It Nm list Oo Fl Fl keys Oc Op Fl Fl timestamp Oo Op Fl Fl json Oc
List the keys stored in the keytab.
Use the
.Fl Fl json
and
.Fl Fl keys
options to export a keytab as JSON for importing with the
.Nm import
command.
.It Nm remove Oo Fl p Ar principal Oc Oo Fl Fl principal= Ns Ar principal Oc \
Oo Fl V kvno Oc Oo Fl Fl kvno= Ns Ar kvno Oc Oo Fl e enctype Oc \
Oo Fl Fl enctype= Ns Ar enctype Oc
Removes the specified key or keys. Not specifying a
.Ar kvno
removes keys with any version number. Not specifying an
.Ar enctype
removes keys of any type.
.It Nm merge Oo Fl Fl copy-duplicates Oc Ar keytab-src Ar keytab-dest
An alias for the
.Nm copy
command.
.It Nm rename Ar from-principal Ar to-principal
Renames all entries for the
.Ar from-principal
in the keytab
.Ar from-principal
to
.Ar to-principal .
.It Nm purge Op Fl Fl age= Ns Ar age
Removes all old versions of a key for which there is a newer version
that is at least
.Ar age
(default one week) old.
Note that this does not update the KDC database.
The
.Xr kadmin 1
command has a
.Nm prune
command that can do this on the KDC side.
