HDB-Ext-KeySet ::= SEQUENCE OF HDB_keyset

--
-- We need a function of current (or given, but it will always be current) time
-- and a base hdb_entry or its HDB-Ext-KeyRotation and service ticket lifetime,
-- that outputs a sequence of {kvno, set_time, max_life} representing past keys
-- (up to one per past and current KeyRotation), current keys (for the current
-- KeyRotation), up to one future key for the current KeyRotation, and up to
-- one future key for the _next_ (future) KeyRotation if there is one.
--
-- We have to impose constraints on new KeyRotation elements of
-- HDB-Ext-KeyRotation.
--
-- So virtual keysets (keytabs) will contain:
--
--  - up to one past   keyset for all KeyRotation periods that are "applicable"
--  - the   current    keyset for all KeyRotation periods that are "applicable"
--  - up to one future keyset for all KeyRotation periods that are "applicable"
--
-- An applicable KeyRotation period is:
--
--  - the KeyRotation whose `epoch` is a) in the past and b) nearest to the
--    current time - we call this the current KeyRotation
--  - a   KeyRotation whose `epoch` is nearest but in the past of the current
--    one
--  - a   KeyRotation whose `epoch` is nearest but in the future of the current
--    one
--
-- A service principal's max ticket life will be bounded by half the current
-- key rotation period.
--
-- Note: There can be more than one applicable past KeyRotation, and more than
--       one applicable KeyRotation.  We might not want to permit this.
--       However, it's probably easier to permit it, though we might not test
--       end-to-end.
--
-- Testing:
--
--  - We should have standalone unit tests for all these pure functions.
--
--  - We should have a test that uses kadm5 and GSS to test against a KDC using
--    small key rotation periods on the order of seconds, with back-off in case
--    of losing a race condition.
