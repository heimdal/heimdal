.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
Dumps ASN.1 DER-encoded values.
If one or more
.Ar TypeName
arguments are given, then
.Nm
will print the value in a JSON-like format using its knowledge of
the ASN.1 modules defining those types, stopping at the first type
for which it can successfully decode the value.
If
.Ar TypeNames
are given, they must be the names of ASN.1 types exported by an
ASN.1 modules that are compiled into
.Nm .
Use the
.Fl Fl try-all-types
option to attempt decoding as all ASN.1 types known to
.Nm .
If neither any
.Ar TypeName
nor
.Fl Fl try-all-types
are given, then the value will be parsed and displayed using just
the self-describing nature of DER.
.Pp
Options supported:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl i, Fl Fl no-indent
Do not indent dump.
.It Fl I, Fl Fl inner
Try to parse inner structures of OCTET STRING and constructed values.
.It Fl l, Fl Fl list-types
List all types known to
.Nm .
.It Fl A, Fl Fl try-all-types
Attempt to decode the value as any of all types known to
.Nm .
.It Fl S, Fl Fl raw-sequence
If a value parses as a given
.Ar TypeName
but any bytes are left over, try to parse those separately as
well until all bytes are consumed or an error occurs.
.It Fl n, Fl Fl no-print
For the case where
.Fl A
or
.Fl Fl try-all-types
or where a
.Ar TypeName
is given, do not output a JSON representation of the value, just
attempt to decode it.
This is useful for fuzzing.
.It Fl q, Fl Fl quiet
Similar to
.Fl n, Fl Fl no-print
but JSON output will be formatted, just not output.
As with
.Fl n, Fl Fl no-print,
this option requires
.Fl A / Fl Fl try-all-types
or that a
.Ar TypeName
be given.
This is useful for fuzzing.
.It Fl Fl test-encode
Check that encoding produces the same value as decoding.
Useful for fuzzing.
.It Fl Fl test-copy
Test copy functions.
Useful for fuzzing.
